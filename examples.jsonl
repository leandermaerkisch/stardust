The tumor cells are arranged in nests and sheets separated by a delicate network of blood vessels. The nuclei are round and uniform with inconspicuous nucleoli, corresponding to Fuhrman nuclear grade 1. No evidence of necrosis, significant mitotic activity, or sarcomatoid differentiation is observed. The findings are indicative of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, Fuhrman Nuclear Grade 1."}

Microscopic examination (H&E) shows rectal mucosa with hyperplastic polyp featuring cystically dilated glands lined by mature epithelium. No dysplasia or carcinoma identified. Diagnosis: Rectal mucosa with hyperplastic polyp, negative for dysplasia or malignancy."}

Surface exhibits a single, sessile polyp measuring 0.7 cm in diameter with a smooth, pink surface. Examination of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections reveals a fragment of rectal mucosa containing a tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia. The adenoma exhibits mildly dysplastic epithelium with slight nuclear atypia and preserved architecture. No evidence of high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma identified. Rectal mucosa with tubular adenoma showing low-grade dysplasia, negative for high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma."}

Microscopic examination reveals a tubular adenoma, a precancerous polyp, showing some abnormal cell features (low-grade dysplasia). However, the architecture of the tissue remains intact, and there is no evidence of more advanced dysplasia or cancer."}
